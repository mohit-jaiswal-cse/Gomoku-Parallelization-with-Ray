# Gomoku-Parallelization-with-Ray 
This software is a Python-based implementation of the popular game Gomoku. Gomoku involves strategically placing player pieces on a 15Ã—15 grid in order to create a straight line of five consecutive pieces, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The code consists of several key components:

### *Game Logic:*
The game's logic is implemented using a two-dimensional NumPy array, which is initialized by the create_board function. Various functions, such as horizontalWins, verticalWin, positive-slopedDiagonalWin, and negative-slopedDiagonalWin, ensure that winning situations are detected in different orientations.

### *Parallelization with Ray:*
To improve performance, certain calculations, such as win-checking, are parallelized using the Ray library. The Ray remote decorator allows the definition of functions that can be executed in parallel.

### *Main Game Loop:*
The main game loop allows participants to take turns placing their pieces on the board. The code automatically detects a winning player after each move, and the game ends once a win is detected.

### *Performance Metrics:*
The code provides information on the execution time of both the serial and parallel sections of the algorithm. It also calculates and displays the speed-up and efficiency achieved by the parallel version.

### *User Interface:*
The Pygame library is used to create a user-friendly interface for the game, allowing players to interact with the game on screen.

### *Graphical Output:*
At the end of the game, the winner is displayed on the screen.

### *Analysis and Efficiency Metrics:*
The code allows for the analysis of speed-up and efficiency for different core configurations and board sizes. This capability is useful for evaluating the performance of parallel algorithms in board games.
